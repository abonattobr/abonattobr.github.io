            <h2>Short Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Assistant Professor at the Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre (UFCSPA) and permanent faculty member in the Department of Exact and Applied Social Sciences (DECESA), working in the Medical Physics program. Also a permanent faculty member of the Graduate Program in Information Technology and Health Management (PPGTIGSaúde), and an accredited co-supervisor in the Nuclear Technology Program at IPEN/USP, in the field of materials. He holds a Bachelor's degree (2005) and a Master's degree (2008) in Physics from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). He earned his PhD in Sciences (concentration in Theoretical Physics) from the same institution.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2013, he completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR), investigating the propagation of laser pulses in plasmas. From 2014 to 2015, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Berkeley Lab Laser Accelerator (BELLA), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL, California, US), studying the use of passive and active plasma lenses for the compact deceleration of highly relativistic electron beams (plasma beam dumps). From 2019 to 2020, he carried out a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Manchester (Manchester, UK), in collaboration with the Cockcroft Institute (Warrington, UK), where he joined the Novel Accelerator Group to investigate the acceleration and deceleration of beams using wakefields excited by laser pulses and electron beams in plasmas.
            </p>
            <p>
                At UFCSPA, he coordinates the Beam Physics Group (GFF), developing research on plasma-based accelerators, photodynamic therapy, proton therapy, very high energy electrons (VHEE) radiotherapy, and new techniques of producing radiopharmaceuticals, making use of machine learning techniques to optimize results obtained from these techniques.
